### **Bank Management System - Data Structures**

#### **Developer**: Nishank Sahu

#### **Language**: C++

#### **Description**:
The **Bank Management System** developed by Nishank Sahu is a C++ application that showcases the use of data structures to manage and streamline typical banking operations. This system is designed to perform various functions such as account creation, transaction processing, and balance inquiries, demonstrating efficient data handling and organization. The project is an excellent example of how data structures can be used to solve practical problems in banking and finance.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Account Management:**
   - Create new accounts with unique identifiers.
   - Store account details including the account holder's name, account number, balance, and transaction history.
   - Ensure data integrity and prevent conflicts with unique account identifiers.

2. **Transaction Management:**
   - Support for multiple transaction types: deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
   - Maintain a detailed transaction history with information such as transaction type, amount, date, and time.
   - Enable easy tracking and transparency of all account activities.

3. **Balance Inquiry:**
   - Allow users to check their account balances quickly and accurately.
   - Reflect real-time balance updates after each transaction to ensure accuracy.

4. **User Interface:**
   - A simple and intuitive interface that guides users through various operations.
   - Ensure user-friendly interaction with clear instructions and prompts.

5. **Security Measures:**
   - Basic validation of input data to prevent errors and unauthorized actions.
   - Emphasis on data integrity and user data protection, crucial for financial applications.

#### **Setup and How to Run:**
To run the Bank Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install a C++ Compiler:**
   - Ensure that a C++ compiler, such as GCC or MSVC, is installed on your system. This is necessary to compile and run the C++ source code.

2. **Download the Source Code:**
   - Obtain the source code file named `Untitled1.cpp`. This file contains all the necessary code to run the Bank Management System.

3. **Compile the Code:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `Untitled1.cpp` is located.
   - Compile the code using a C++ compiler command, for example:
     ```
     g++ -o BankManagementSystem Untitled1.cpp
     ```
   - This command compiles the source code and generates an executable file named `BankManagementSystem`.

4. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program by running the following command:
     ```
     ./BankManagementSystem
     ```
   - This will start the Bank Management System application.

5. **Using the System:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to create accounts, process transactions, and inquire about balances.
   - Enter data as prompted, such as account details and transaction amounts, to interact with the system's features.

6. **Exit the Program:**
   - The application may offer a specific option to exit. Choose this option when you wish to terminate the program.

This project not only serves as a practical application but also as a learning tool for understanding the role of data structures in software development, particularly in financial contexts. Through its clear organization and practical functionalities, the Bank Management System illustrates the fundamental concepts of data handling and user interface design.
